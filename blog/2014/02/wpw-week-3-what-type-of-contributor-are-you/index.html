              </header>
              <p>When I first edited a webplatform.org page, I was very nervous. I have experience (I won&#39;t mention the number of years…) with both technical content and editing. So I expected to come to webplatform.org and dig into the content and change it easily. That wasn&#39;t my experience. Whether it&#39;s because of the MediaWiki markup or the expert eyes on the content or the instability of the site, I&#39;m not sure, but I was intimidated. It didn&#39;t help that just about the first contribution I made (after consulting with a couple of folks) was reversed by someone halfway around the world, in the middle of my night.</p>
<p>I&#39;d consider myself a &quot;Nervous Nelly&quot; as they say. Or after that first experience, I&#39;d call that contributor &quot;Tim Idreget.&quot;*</p>
<p><a href="http://static.webplatform.org/blog/2014/02/tim-idregret_sm.jpg"><img src="//static.webplatform.org/blog/2014/02/tim-idregret_sm.jpg" alt=" "></a></p>
<p>Yes, that was me: timidly pushing ahead only to regret doing so. But that&#39;s ridiculous. No one cared. I made an edit, someone thought it wasn&#39;t correct and changed it back. Someone just as unfamiliar with the site as I was. Someone who wasn&#39;t privy to our discussion around the table. Someone who was trying to get through the tasks he wanted to do.</p>
<p>But what to do? Change it back to my way? Play tug-o-war? Leave it quietly and walk away? What to do?</p>
<p>Ask <a href="/docs/wiki/User:Shepazu">Shepazu</a>! And of course, that was the best, because he said – and I&#39;m not quoting here, but something to the effect of – <em>This indicates that one of you doesn&#39;t understand what the other is doing. Send a query and get it cleared up.</em> And I did and it did.</p>
<p><img src="//static.webplatform.org/blog/2014/02/rip-enburn_sm.jpg" alt=" ">But that brings me to another type of contributor. Let&#39;s call him Rip, Rip Enburn. His sense of self proceeds himself. He&#39;s not concerned with the page&#39;s history: who edited this when and exactly what did they do – who cares? He&#39;s on a roll, taking no prisoners, going for speed, and all that. Fortunately, I haven&#39;t come across any of these on webplatform.org. But they&#39;re out there. As an innocent lamb, if some of your content has been ripped to shreds, follow up. Make sure you know why. Get a second opinion. Rip may, in fact, not be right, or have even noticed that he clobbered something – or someone – along the way.</p>
<p>OK, I have to say it. Although they will not be given a stage name, there&#39;s another contributor that is hard to take. It&#39;s the armchair contributor.<a href="http://static.webplatform.org/blog/2014/02/armchair-contributor_sm.jpg">
<img src="//static.webplatform.org/blog/2014/02/armchair-contributor_sm.jpg" alt=" "></a></p>
<p>Named after the armchair philosopher, they observe, they postulate, they provide commentary, but they don&#39;t edit the actual page! (There&#39;s an interesting discussion on wikipedia.org about armchair philosophy under the heading &quot;Armchair theorizing.&quot; A more visceral definition can be found in the Urban Dictionary.)</p>
<p>And, to tell you the truth, I&#39;ve been one of these myself. It&#39;s so much easier to lie in wait for someone else to make a contribution, and contribute <em>suggestions</em> on how they contributed. I have been to &quot;community&quot; sites and said &quot;this is really bad&quot; or &quot;just bad,&quot; and even left a comment to that effect. But did I stick around to offer a solution or take it to a resolution?</p>
<p>At any rate, what I want to be – what I want for you to be – is a confident contributor, like Connie Fident. She has a lot of hands, because she can work so creatively and smoothly, always knowing what to contribute, and how, within just the right amount of time.</p>
<p><img src="//static.webplatform.org/blog/2014/02/connie-fident_sm.jpg" alt=" "></p>
<p>But, really the only way we&#39;re going to get there is to actually edit the pages themselves, and share our experiences and help each other improve, and then edit the pages themselves.</p>
<p>Whatever type of contributor you are, please do join us this week as we continue to <a href="/docs/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday">improve the Array object and its properties, function and methods</a>. We&#39;ve broken out some of the <a href="/docs/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/js_basic_facts_tasks">tasks involved with editing the basic facts</a>. So let us know if that takes off the edge to editing a page. Or let us know what type of contributor you are and how we can improve the experience for you. Don&#39;t be shy, just edit a page and let us know how it went by emailing <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/">the public list</a>.</p>
